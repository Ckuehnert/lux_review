    "## Analyzing Production Data with Python's LUX library\n",
    "### Performing a predictive maintenance task with interactive visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "Working as Data scientists, we all know that we spend most of our time in exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and preprocessing. Often, developing Machine Learning, doing all the training, validation, and testing stuff are less of the work. Some ML-Models perform better than others, you play around with some parameters and you end up with better or worse results. But usually, you will end up quite fast in finding a model that works well on the data.\\\n",
    "Therefore, the question is how to speed up the initial exploratory data analysis step. Since this step involves lots of interactive work one possible solution is to work with so-called no-code or low-code libraries. Using these libraries allows you to quickly check your data set with strongly reduced or even without the need to code. In other words, you can completely concentrate on the creative work for analyzing the data set. \\\\\n",
    "Within Python, several low-code/no-code libraries have already come to the market, while in this article, we will focus on [Lux](https://github.com/lux-org/lux). Lux promotes itself as being a Python library, that automates the visualization and data analysis process while working on Pandas DataFrames. Therefore, Lux automatically proposes to highlight interesting trends and patterns in the underlying dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Use Case\n",
    "There are already several tutorials available on the net that use Lux for data analysis. Still, most of the tutorials work on smaller data sets with the focus to give a general introduction to Lux. Therefore, in this article, we will try to get some insights into larger data coming from the production area. \\\n",
    "The dataset has been introduced in 2020 at the AI4I conference within [this](https://github.com/lux-org/lux) paper and afterwards has been uploaded to the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It is freely available and can be downloaded following this [link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/AI4I+2020+Predictive+Maintenance+Dataset). \\\n",
    "In summary, the data set describes a simulation of a production plant consisting of 10 000 data points and 14 features. For our task the following columns are of interest: \n",
    "\n",
    "- type: This column consists of the letters L, M and H. L stands for low (50% of all products), M for medium (30%) and H for a high (20%) product quality variant.\n",
    "- air temperature [K]: Generated from a random walk and around 300 Kelvin\n",
    "- process temperature [K]: Generated through a random walk and added to the air temperature plus 10 Kelvin\n",
    "- rotational speed [rpm]: Calculated using a power of 2860 W and overlaid with a normally distributed noise\n",
    "- torque [Nm]: Normally distributed values around 40 Nm\n",
    "- tool wear [min]: For the quality variants, H/M/L 5/3/2 minutes are added of tool wear to the used tool in the process.\n",
    "- machine failure: Label that indicates, whether the machine has failed or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of even more information, e.g. giving details on why the machine failed. But since we don't want to figure that out, the other columns will be neglected. In summary, the goal for the use case can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "**Find some possible reason why the machine failed by using interactive visualizations from the Lux library**\n",
    "\n",
    "### A quick survey on other libraries:\n",
    "As mentioned in the introduction, there are several low-code/no-code libraries available in Python. Here is just a quick review of some others: \n",
    "\n",
    "- [Bamboolib](https://bamboolib.8080labs.com/): Is a GUI that works on pandas DataFrames and can be easily integrated into Jupyter notebooks. It is quite interactive to visualize and analyze data sets. Unfortunately, it is not open source and the free version only gives you access to a limited number of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Mito](https://trymito.io/): Adds some sort of an Excel Spreadsheet to your Jupyter notebook. The changes you make in the spreadsheet are translated into python code.  This is especially interesting for Citizen Data Scientists since they can perform their data analysis in a familiar environment\n",
    "\n",
    "- [PyCaret](https://pycaret.org/): This is less about exploratory data analysis, but provides a low-code ML-library. It is especially suited for people new to data science, as you can solve complete ML tasks with very few lines of code\n",

    "\n",
    "- It is impressive how few lines of code are needed. Furthermore, it is not complicated to understand them\n",
    "- it is impressive that almost no statistical knowledge is required. You need to have a basic understanding of scatter plots and histograms, but that's it.\n",
    "- No ML/AI was needed to find one of the reasons for machine failures. Keep in mind, that this is a common result when analyzing production data. A sharp look at the production data with some domain knowledge is often enough to get new insights into the data.\n",
    "- Finally, the most impressive thing was how quickly and intuitive it was to navigate through the dataset. By not having to write code, it is possible to focus on the main task, analyze the process data and gain new insights.\n",
